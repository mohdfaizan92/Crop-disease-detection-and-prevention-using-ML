# 🌾 Crop Disease Detection and Prevention using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting crop diseases from leaf images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. It aims to help farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases early and take preventive actions to improve crop health and yield.

## 📌 Features

- 🌿 Detects diseases in crops like Tomato, Potato, Corn, Cotton, etc.
- 📸 Image-based diagnosis using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- 📊 Accuracy and performance evaluation of models
- 🧠 Trained on publicly available PlantVillage dataset
- 📈 Visualization of results and model performance
- 🖥️ Streamlit web application for user interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Streamlit (for web interface)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)
